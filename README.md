# Data_Analytics_For_Healthcare_Applications

This repository presents a comprehensive suite of implementations focused on healthcare data analysis, predictive modeling, biomedical image processing, natural language processing, and genomic data mining. It encompasses both clinical and non-clinical data sources to support informed healthcare insights and decision-making.

**Scope of Work**

1. Biomedical Image Processing
- Image preprocessing (normalization, filtering, enhancement)
- Segmentation, feature extraction, and anomaly detection techniques
2. Clinical Data Mining
- Mining structured and unstructured clinical records to uncover patterns and support clinical decision-making
3. Chronic Disease Management
- Data mining on non-clinical datasets (e.g., lifestyle, environmental data) for early detection and prevention strategies
4. Medical Text Analysis using NLP
- Extraction of patient-centric insights using domain-specific NLP models
- Named Entity Recognition (NER), topic modeling, and summarization
5. Clinical Text Information Extraction
- Implementation of rule-based, pattern-based, and machine learning techniques for transforming unstructured clinical text into structured datasets
6. Statistical Predictive Modeling
- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers applied to clinical datasets for risk prediction and classification
7. Machine Learning Models for Health Prediction
- Development of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network models for predictive tasks
8. Social Media-Based Pandemic Prediction
- Acquisition and analysis of pandemic-related data from social media platforms
- Outbreak prediction using trend analysis and forecasting models
9. Genomic Data Mining
- Preprocessing and analysis of genome sequence data
- Application of clustering, classification, and sequence analysis techniques
